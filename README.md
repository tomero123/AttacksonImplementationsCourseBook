## HOWTO Compile
### Windows
#### Toolchain Installation
1. Install MikTex from: https://miktex.org/download (with default settings). NOTE that although Tex Live is suposedly a decent alternative to MikTex on windows - attempts to use it for compiling the book failed miserably.
2. Install Perl from: http://strawberryperl.com/
3. [Optional but Recommended] Install VSCode and the **LaTeX Workshop** extension to be able to compile from VSCode.
4. [Optional but Recommended] Install the **LaTex language support** VSCode extension to ease editing in VSCode.
#### Full book Compilation
- From VSCode: open UniversityCourseBookAOI.tex, click on the "TEX" icon in the left sidebar, run the "Build LaTeX project" command.
- Without VSCode: run `latexmk` from the root directory of the book repository

It goes on to discuss different kinds of fault methods (power supply attacks, timing attacks, temperature attacks, and more), further giving examples of classic fault attacks targeting the control flow: [Canon camera blinking](https://chdk.fandom.com/wiki/Obtaining_a_firmware_dump#Q._How_can_I_get_a_firmware_dump.3F), and [Unloopers](https://www.oocities.org/wild_lightning21/hardware/unlooper.htm). We then examine a fault attack on RSA-CRT as presented by Boneh and Lipton in [On the importance of eliminating errors in cryptographic computations](https://doi.org/10.1007/s001450010016);
